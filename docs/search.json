In our context, we consider the set \\[\n\\calD := \\left\\lbrace\n\\sum_{i=1}^n \\lambda_i \\delta_{x_i}\\mid \\lambda_i &gt; 0, ~\\sum_{i=1}^n \\lambda_i = 1,~x_i\\in\\bbR^d,~ n\\in \\mathbb{N}\n\\right\\rbrace,\n\\] which consists of finite convex combinations of Dirac measures.\nThe notion of density (not to be confused with the density of a measure) is understood in terms of the Wasserstein metric, not in terms of weak convergence or total variation. To understand the distinction, consider the following example. Think of the true distribution as a smooth landscape and discrete point masses as piles of sand. Wasserstein distance measures the work needed to move the sand to match the landscape, capturing both where the mass lies (location) and how much lies there (moment). Weak convergence is like viewing the scene from far away. You see whether piles are roughly in the correct places but ignore how tall they are. That means, moments may diverge. Total variation demands every grain be placed exactly right, which can be far too strict for sample-based approximation.\nPositioned between those extremes, \\(W_2\\) guarantees (1) weak convergence plus convergence of second moments, and (2) expectations for functions with quadratic growth. These make it an ideal notion for statistical applications where second-moment behavior is central. With this clarified, now let’s prove that \\(\\calD\\) is dense in \\((\\calP_2, W_2)\\)."

    "title": "The space of Dirac measures is dense in Wasserstein space",
    "section": "4 Proof",
    "text": "4 Proof\nThe proof consists of three parts for easy understanding.\n\n4.1 Truncation to Compact Support\nWe want to show that dirac measures can approximate any measure \\(\\mu \\in \\calP_2(\\bbR^d)\\). For each \\(R &gt; 0\\), define the closed ball of radius \\(R\\) centered at the origin as \\[\nB(0,R):=\\lbrace x\\in\\bbR^d \\mid \\|x\\| \\leq R \\rbrace.\n\\] We construct a truncated version of \\(\\mu\\) supported on this ball. Define the measure \\(\\mu_R\\) by \\[\\begin{equation}\n\\mu_R(A) = \\frac{\\mu(A\\cap B(0,R))}{\\mu(B(0,R))},\n\\end{equation}\\] for all Borel sets \\(A \\subset \\bbR^d\\). This is a probability measure supported on \\(B(0,R)\\), provided \\(\\mu(B(0,R))&gt;0\\). Since \\(\\mu \\in \\calP_2\\), we have \\(\\mu(B(0,R)) \\to 1\\) as \\(R \\to \\infty\\).\nWe now verify that \\(W_2(\\mu_R, \\mu) \\to 0\\) as \\(R \\to \\infty\\). To do this, define a coupling \\(\\gamma_R \\in \\Gamma(\\mu,\\mu_R)\\) by setting \\[\n\\gamma_R := \\frac{1}{\\mu(B(0,R))}\\cdot \\mu\\vert_{B(0,R)}(x) \\otimes \\delta_x (y) \\in \\calP_2(\\bbR^d \\times \\bbR^d).\n\\] This coupling transports mass inside \\(B(0,R)\\) directly to itself while the mass outside the ball is ignored. Then, \\[\n\\int \\|x-y\\|^2 d \\gamma_R (x,y) = \\frac{1}{\\mu(B(0,R))} \\int_{B(0,R)} \\|x - x\\|^2 d\\mu(x) = 0.\n\\] Therefore, the transport cost under this coupling is zero inside the ball, but there is unmatched mass outside, which we account for.\nNow consider the decomposition \\[\nW_2^2(\\mu,\\mu_R) \\leq \\int_{\\bbR^d \\backslash B(0,R)} \\|x\\|^2 d\\mu(x) + (1-\\mu(B(0,R)))\\cdot R^2.\n\\] The first term represents contribution of tail mass and the second term is cost of reallocating mass. As \\(R\\to\\infty\\), the first term vanishes because of integrability of \\(\\|x\\|^2\\). We also know that the second term vanishes as well since \\(\\mu(B(0,R)) \\rightarrow 1\\). Therefore, \\[\n\\lim_{R\\to \\infty} W_2 (\\mu, \\mu_R)  = 0.\n\\]\n\n\n4.2 Quantization to Finitely Supported Measures\nFix \\(R&gt;0\\) and let \\(\\mu_R\\) be the compactly supported measure we just constructed. Since \\(\\mu_R\\) is supported on a compact set \\(K = B(0,R)\\), we can apply a canonical quantization argument. Partition the set \\(K\\) into a finite number of disjoint Borel sets \\(Q_1, \\ldots, Q_k\\) such that:\nFor each \\(i=1,\\ldots,k\\), choose a representative point \\(x_i \\in Q_i\\) and define the finitely supported measure \\[\n\\mu_R^\\epsilon := \\sum_{i=1}^k \\mu_R (Q_i) \\delta_{x_i} \\in \\calD.\n\\] We can construct a coupling \\(\\gamma \\in \\Gamma(\\mu_R, \\mu_R^\\epsilon)\\) by pushing the entire mass from \\(Q_i\\) to \\(x_i\\). Then, \\[\nW_2^2(\\mu_R, \\mu_R^\\epsilon) \\leq \\sum_{i=1}^k \\int_{Q_i}  \\|x - x_i\\|^2 d\\mu_R(x) \\leq \\epsilon^2.\n\\] Hence, \\(W_2 (\\mu_R, \\mu_R^\\epsilon) \\leq \\epsilon\\).\n\n\n4.3 Convergence via Triangle Inequality\nNow fix an arbitrary \\(\\delta &gt; 0\\). From the first step, one can choose \\(R\\) large enough so that \\[\nW_2(\\mu,\\mu_R) &lt; \\frac{\\delta}{2}.\n\\] From the second step, \\(\\epsilon\\) can be chosen small enough so that \\[\nW_2 (\\mu_R, \\mu_R^\\epsilon) &lt; \\frac{\\delta}{2}.\n\\] By the triangle inequality, we arrive at the following result: \\[\nW_2(\\mu,\\mu_R^\\epsilon) \\leq W_2(\\mu,\\mu_R) + W_2 (\\mu_R, \\mu_R^\\epsilon) &lt; \\frac{\\delta}{2}+\\frac{\\delta}{2} = \\delta.\n\\] Since \\(\\mu_R^\\epsilon \\in \\calD\\), we have shown that for any \\(\\mu \\in \\calP_2(\\bbR^d)\\) and any \\(\\delta &gt; 0\\), there exists a finitely supported measure \\(\\nu \\in \\calD\\) such that \\(W_2(\\mu, \\nu) &lt; \\delta\\).\nThus, the set \\(\\calD\\) is dense in \\((\\calP_2(\\bbR^d), W_2)\\)."

Indeed, it plays a foundational role in the theory and computation of Bayesian inference.\n\n5.1 Empirical Posteriors Are Dirac Mixtures\nIn Bayesian analysis, the posterior distribution \\(\\pi(\\theta\\mid x)\\) encodes all inferential information about the parameter \\(\\theta\\) given the data \\(x\\). In most real-world problems, \\(\\pi(\\theta\\mid x)\\) is analytically intractable. As a result, we approximate it using samples from methods like Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC), producing a sequence \\(\\theta_1, \\ldots, \\theta_N \\sim \\pi(\\theta\\mid x)\\).\nOnce a run is done, this gives rise to the empirical posterior distribution \\[\n\\hat{\\pi}_N = \\frac{1}{N}\\sum_{i=1}^N \\delta_{\\theta_i} \\in \\calD,\n\\] which is a discrete measure (a Dirac mixture) and lies in the dense subset \\(\\calD \\subset \\calP_2 (\\bbR^d)\\).

    "text": "6 Broader Implications\nThe density of finitely supported measures in Wasserstein space has far-reaching implications that extend well beyond Bayesian computation. At its core, this result gives us permission to treat discrete, empirical approximations as valid proxies for continuous distributions not only heuristically, but with full mathematical justification. This has become increasingly important as modern statistics moves into spaces where distributions are themselves the objects of inference, optimization, or learning.\nFor instance, a wide range of statistical and machine learning tasks now involve minimizing functionals over probability distributions. Examples include optimal transport-based clustering, distributional regression, and geometric learning in Wasserstein space. These problems are naturally infinite-dimensional, yet thanks to the density of point masses, we can safely approximate them using discrete measures. Algorithms that work with samples or particles, such as those in variational inference, particle filtering, or Wasserstein generative modeling, operate entirely within this discrete subset, and the density result assures us that they remain close, in a precise metric sense, to the true solution.\nMoreover, this result forms the basis for understanding the behavior of empirical distributions in a quantitative way. In high-dimensional settings, we care not just about whether empirical averages converge, but about how distributions themselves behave under finite sampling. Rate of convergence results like Fournier and Guillin (2015), which provide non-asymptotic convergence rates for empirical measures in Wasserstein distance, rely on the fact that empirical distributions belong to a dense subset of the space. Without such a density property, these convergence rates would lack grounding.\nIt also enables the practical use of geometric concepts such as Wasserstein barycenters, Fréchet means, and transport-based medians. These objects, while defined over general distributions, are often computed from discrete empirical measures. That this is not just a computational shortcut but a theoretically valid procedure is precisely because of this density: the geometric structure of Wasserstein space remains stable under approximation by point masses.\nPerhaps most importantly, the result builds a conceptual bridge between infinite-dimensional theory and finite-sample practice. In probability, statistics, and machine learning, we often formulate problems in terms of idealized objects - true distributions, functional risk, geometric flows - but ultimately implement solutions with finite data. The density of Dirac mixtures in Wasserstein space assures us that this transition from the infinite to the finite is not a compromise, but a convergence."

It is a cornerstone of modern computational probability. It tells us that empirical approximations, such as those arising from MCMC, live in the same geometric space as the distributions they seek to estimate. It validates our use of discrete measures in place of continuous ones, not only for computing expectations or variances, but for solving full distributional problems.\nThis result is what allows us to define geometric estimators on sampled data, aggregate distributions across models or machines, and design optimization algorithms that operate directly on measures. It is what ensures that Wasserstein gradient flows, barycenters, and interpolation paths remain meaningful when applied to empirical distributions. It is what gives us the confidence to work with particles, while knowing we are still faithfully navigating the geometry of probability."

    "section": "Angular Central Gaussian Distribution",
    "text": "Angular Central Gaussian Distribution\nOn \\(\\mathbb{S}^{p-1}\\), the ACG distribution \\(ACG_p (A)\\) as a density \\[\nf_{ACG} (x\\vert A) = |A|^{-1/2} (x^\\top Ax)^{-p/2}\n\\] for \\(x \\in \\mathbb{S}^{p-1}\\) and \\(A\\) a symmetric positive-definite matrix, i.e., \\(A=A^\\top \\in \\mathbb{R}^{p\\times p}\\) with \\(\\lambda_{min}(A)&gt;0\\). Let’s recap some properties of ACG distribution.\n\nProperty 1. \\(f_{ACG}(x|A) = f_{ACG}(-x|A)\\). This enables ACG as a distribution on the real projective space \\(\\mathbb{R}P^{p-1} = \\mathbb{S}^{p-1}/\\lbrace +1, -1 \\rbrace\\).\nProperty 2. \\(f_{ACG}(x|A) = f_{ACG}(x|cA),~c&gt;0\\). Common convention is to normalize the matrix \\(A\\) by a constraint \\(\\textrm{tr}(A) = p\\), which is useful (or even essential) in maximum likelihood estimation of the parameter to ensure algorithmic stability. If you want to show this property, simply use the fact that \\(|cA| = c^p|A|\\).\nProperty 3. When \\(x\\sim \\mathcal{N}_p (0,A) \\rightarrow x/\\|x\\| \\sim ACG_p (A)\\). This property is indeed an intuition behind its origination (Tyler 1987), which can be used for sampling.\n\n\nMaximum Likelihood Estimation\nGiven a random sample \\(x_1, \\ldots, x_p \\sim ACG_p (A)\\), Tyler (1987) proposed an iterative updating scheme to estimate the parameter \\(A\\) by\n\n\\[\\hat{A}_{k+1} = p \\left\\lbrace \\sum_{i=1}^n \\frac{1}{x_i^\\top \\hat{A}_k^{-1} x_i} \\right\\rbrace^{-1} \\sum_{i=1}^n \\frac{x_i x_i^\\top}{x_i^\\top \\hat{A}_k^{-1} x_i}, \\tag{1}\\]\n\nwhere \\(\\hat{A}_k\\) is the \\(k\\)-th iterate of an estimator with an initial starting point of an identity matrix \\(\\hat{A}_0 = I_p\\). While Equation 1 guarantees the convergence under mild conditions and abides by the constraint \\(\\textrm{tr}(\\hat{A}_k) = p\\), it is from the author’s previous work on \\(M\\)-estimation of the scatter matrix. Here, we provide a naive derivation of 2-step fixed-point iteration algorithm for pedagogical purpose.\n\n\\[\\hat{A}_{k'} = \\frac{p}{n}\\sum_{i=1}^n \\frac{x_i x_i^\\top}{x_i^\\top \\hat{A}_k^{-1} x_i}\\,\\,\\textrm{and}\\,\\, \\hat{A}_{k+1} = \\frac{p}{\\textrm{tr}(\\hat{A}_{k'})} \\hat{A}_{k'}. \\tag{2}\\]\n\nFirst, let’s write the log-likelihood \\[\n\\log L = -\\frac{n}{2}\\log\\det(A) - \\frac{p}{2} \\sum_{i=1}^n \\log (x_i^\\top A^{-1} x_i),\n\\] and recall two facts from matrix calculus (Petersen and Pedersen 2012/nov) that \\[\n\\frac{\\partial \\log\\det(A)}{\\partial A} = A^{-1}\\,\\,\\textrm{and}\\,\\, \\frac{\\partial x^\\top A^{-1} x}{\\partial A} = -A^{-1}xx^\\top A^{-1}.\n\\] Then, the first-order condition for the log-likelihood can be written as\n\\[\n\\begin{gather*}\n    \\frac{\\partial \\log L}{\\partial A} = -\\frac{n}{2} A^{-1} + \\frac{p}{2} \\sum_{i=1}^n \\frac{A^{-1} x_i x_i^\\top A^{-1}}{x_i^\\top A^{-1} x_i} \\\\\n    A^{-1} = \\frac{p}{n} \\sum_{i=1}^n \\frac{A^{-1} x_i x_i^\\top A^{-1}}{x_i^\\top A^{-1} x_i} \\\\\n    A = \\frac{p}{n} \\sum_{i=1}^n \\frac{ x_i x_i^\\top }{x_i^\\top A^{-1} x_i}\n\\end{gather*}\n\\] where the last equality comes from multiplying \\(A\\) from left and right. Therefore, \\(\\hat{A}\\) is a solution of the matrix equation in a form \\(X = f(X)\\) where \\(f\\) is a contraction mapping under some conditions (Tyler 1987). This leads to Equation 2 while projection step is added to keep \\(\\text{tr}(\\hat{A}_k) = p\\) for all \\(k=1,2,\\cdots\\)."

    "title": "What is the Angular Central Gaussian distribution?",
    "section": "Matrix Angular Central Gaussian Distribution",
    "text": "Matrix Angular Central Gaussian Distribution\nChikuse (2003) extended the distribution to the matrix case, namely Stiefel and Grassmann manifolds \\[\n\\begin{gather*}\n    St(p,r) = \\{X\\in \\mathbb{R}^{p\\times r} ~\\vert~ X^\\top X = I_p\\}\\\\\n    Gr(p,r) = \\{\\text{Span}(X) ~\\vert~ X \\in \\mathbb{R}^{p\\times r},~\\text{rank}(X)=r\\}\n\\end{gather*}\n\\] which are sets of orthonormal \\(k\\)-frames and \\(k\\)-subspaces. The Matrix Angular Central Gaussian (MACG) distribution \\(MACG_{p,r}(\\Sigma)\\) has a density \\[\nf_{MACG}(X\\vert \\Sigma) = |\\Sigma|^{-r/2} |X^\\top \\Sigma^{-1} X|^{-p/2}\n\\] where \\(\\Sigma\\) is a symmetric positive-definite matrix. Note that the density is very similar to what we had before for vector-valued distribution. Likewise, it shares properties as before.\n\nProperty 1. \\(f_{MACG}(X|\\Sigma) = f_{MACG}(-X|\\Sigma)\\).\nProperty 2. \\(f_{MACG}(X|\\Sigma) = f_{MACG}(X|c\\Sigma),~c&gt;0\\).\nProperty 3. \\(f_{MACG}(X|\\Sigma) = f_{MACG}(XR|\\Sigma)\\) for \\(R\\in O(r)\\). This property enables to consider MACG as a distribution on Grassmann manifold, which are quotient by modulo orthogonal transformation.\n\n\nSampling from MACG\nIn order to draw random samples from \\(MACG_{p,r}(\\Sigma)\\), we need the following steps, which are common in directional statistics with Stiefel/Grassmann manifolds . First, draw \\(r\\) random vectors \\(x_1,\\ldots,x_r \\sim \\mathcal{N}_p (0,\\Sigma)\\) and stack them as columns \\(X=[x_1|\\cdots|x_r] \\in \\mathbb{R}^{p\\times r}\\). Then, \\[\n    Y = X (X^\\top X)^{-1/2} \\sim MACG_{p,r}(\\Sigma)\n\\] where the negative square root for a symmetric positive-definite matrix can be obtained from eigen-decomposition, \\[\n\\begin{gather*}\n\\Omega = UDU^\\top \\rightarrow \\Omega^{-1/2} = UD^{-1/2} U^\\top \\\\\n\\left[D^{-1/2}\\right]_{ij} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{d_{ij}}} \\textrm{ when } i = j \\textrm{ and }0\\textrm{ otherwise.}\n\\end{gather*}\n\\]\n\n\nMaximum Likelihood Estimation\nSimilar to the ACG case, given a random sample \\(X_1,X_2,\\ldots,X_n \\sim MACG_{p,r}(\\Sigma)\\), we can obtain a two-step iterative scheme to estimate the parameter \\(\\Sigma\\),\n\n\\[\\begin{gather*}\n\\hat{\\Sigma}_{k'} = \\frac{p}{nr} \\sum_{i=1}^n\nX_i (X_i^\\top \\Sigma^{-1} X_i)^{-1} X_i \\\\\n\\hat{\\Sigma}_{k+1} =  \\frac{p}{\\text{tr}(\\hat{\\Sigma}_{k'})} \\hat{\\Sigma}_{k'}.\\end{gather*} \\tag{3}\\]\n\nDerivation of formula Equation 3 follows the similar line of before. We need another fact from matrix calculus that \\[\n\\frac{\\partial }{\\partial \\Sigma} \\log\\det(X^\\top \\Sigma^{-1} X) = - \\Sigma^{-1} X (X^\\top \\Sigma^{-1} X)^{-1} X^\\top \\Sigma^{-1}.\n\\] First, log-likelihood is written as \\[\n    \\log L  = -\\frac{nr}{2}\\log\\det(\\Sigma) - \\frac{p}{2}\\sum_{i=1}^n \\log\\det (X_i^\\top \\Sigma^{-1} X_i)\n\\] where the first-order condition gives \\[\n\\begin{gather*}\n    \\frac{\\partial \\log L}{\\partial \\Sigma} = -\\frac{nr}{2}\\Sigma^{-1} + \\frac{p}{2}\\sum_{i=1}^n \\left( \\Sigma^{-1} X_i (X_i^\\top \\Sigma^{-1} X_i)^{-1} X_i^\\top \\Sigma^{-1} \\right)\\\\\n    \\frac{nr}{2} \\Sigma^{-1} = \\frac{p}{2}\\sum_{i=1}^n \\left( \\Sigma^{-1} X_i (X_i^\\top \\Sigma^{-1} X_i)^{-1} X_i^\\top \\Sigma^{-1} \\right) \\\\\n    \\Sigma = \\frac{p}{nr} \\sum_{i=1}^n X_i (X_i^\\top \\Sigma^{-1} X_i)^{-1} X_i^\\top\n\\end{gather*}\n\\] where the last equality comes from multiplying \\(\\Sigma\\) from left and right. Therefore, \\(\\hat{\\Sigma}\\) is a solution of the matrix equation, leading to the formula of Equation 3 with an additional projection step to keep \\(\\text{tr}(\\hat{\\Sigma}_k) = p\\) for all \\(k=1,2,\\cdots\\). Note that this matrix equation, up to my knowledge, has not known whether the mapping is contraction or not."

    "section": "",
    "text": "\\[\n\\newcommand{\\bbR}{\\mathbb{R}}\n\\newcommand{\\calD}{\\mathcal{D}}\n\\newcommand{\\calM}{\\mathcal{M}}\n\\newcommand{\\calP}{\\mathcal{P}}\n\\DeclareMathOperator{\\argmin}{argmin}\n\\]\nOne of the most fundamental objects in geometric statistics and computation thereof is the squared Riemannian distance function \\(d^2(p,q)\\) defined on a Riemannian manifold \\((\\calM, g)\\). This function is central to optimization, variational formulations, and the definition of Fréchet means on manifolds. A key identity often invoked but not always derived is: \\[\n\\nabla_x d^2(x,y) = -2\\log_x y,\n\\] where \\(\\log_x y\\) is the logarithmic map, which pulls a point \\(y\\) to the tangent space at \\(x\\)1. This is the manifold generalization of the Euclidean identity \\(\\nabla_x \\|x-y\\|^2 = -2(y-x)\\), where \\(\\|\\cdot\\|\\) is the Euclidean norm.\nI first encountered this identity when I was writing my own code during my doctoral studies. I encountered the proof on Stack Exchange, but at that time it was of no use for me. Later I learned that one can show this identity in several ways, and here is mine.\nLet \\(f(x) = d^2(x,y)\\) be the square distance function. As you can see, this is a function of \\(x\\) only with a fixed \\(y\\in\\calM\\). Our goal is to compute the Riemannian gradient \\(\\nabla_x f(x)\\).\nWe start with a smooth curve \\(\\gamma(t)\\) on the manifold \\(\\calM\\) such that \\(\\gamma(0) = x\\) (initial location) and \\(\\dot{\\gamma}(0) = \\xi \\in T_x \\calM\\) (initial velocity). Then the directional derivative of \\(f\\) at \\(x\\) along \\(\\xi\\) is defined as \\[\nDf(x)[\\xi] = \\frac{d}{dt}f(\\gamma(t))\\bigg|_{t=0} = \\frac{d}{dt}d^2(\\gamma(t),y)\\bigg|_{t=0},\n\\] and we can apply the chain rule to the squared distance: \\[\n\\frac{d}{dt}d^2(\\gamma(t),y)\\bigg|_{t=0} = 2d(\\gamma(t),y)\\cdot  \\frac{d}{dt}d(\\gamma(t),y)\\bigg|_{t=0} = 2d(x,y)\\cdot \\frac{d}{dt}d(\\gamma(t),y)\\bigg|_{t=0}.\n\\] To compute the derivative, we invoke the first variation formula for the Riemannian distance. Let \\(\\gamma_s (t)\\) denote the minimizing geodesic from \\(\\alpha(s)\\) to \\(y\\), and define the variation of geodesics \\[\n\\tilde{\\gamma}(s,t):= \\gamma_s (t),\n\\] with \\(\\tilde{\\gamma}(0,t) = \\gamma(t)\\) being the geodesic from \\(x\\) to \\(y\\). Let \\(E(s) := d(\\alpha(s), y)\\). Then \\(E(s)^2\\) is the energy of the minimizing geodesic \\(\\gamma_s\\), i.e., \\[\nE(s)^2 = \\int_{0}^{1} \\bigg\\| \\frac{\\partial \\tilde{\\gamma}}{\\partial t}(s,t) \\bigg\\|^2 dt.\n\\] Hence, \\[\nE'(0) = \\frac{1}{2d(x,y)} \\cdot \\left. \\frac{d}{ds} \\int_{0}^{1} \\left\\| \\frac{\\partial \\tilde{\\gamma}}{\\partial t}(s,t) \\right\\|^2 dt \\right|_{s=0}.\n\\] We now use the first variation formula for energy functional: if \\(\\tilde{\\gamma}(s,t)\\) is a variation of geodesics such that \\(\\tilde{\\gamma}(s,1) = y\\) is fixed and \\(\\tilde{\\gamma}(s,0) = \\alpha(s)\\), then \\[\n\\left. \\frac{d}{ds} \\int_{0}^{1} \\left\\| \\frac{\\partial \\tilde{\\gamma}}{\\partial t}(s,t) \\right\\|^2 dt \\right|_{s=0} = -2 \\left\\langle \\dot{\\gamma}(0), \\dot{\\alpha}(0) \\right\\rangle.\n\\] Here, \\(\\gamma(t) = \\tilde{\\gamma}(0,t)\\) is the minimizing geodesic from \\(x\\) to \\(y\\), and \\(\\dot{\\gamma}(0)\\) is its initial velocity vector. By definition of the Riemannian logarithmic map, \\[\n\\dot{\\gamma}(0) = \\frac{\\log_x y}{\\|\\log_x y \\|}\\cdot d(x,y).\n\\] Therefore, \\[\nE'(0) = \\frac{1}{2d(x,y)}\\cdot \\left(-2 \\langle \\dot{\\gamma}(0), \\xi \\rangle \\right) = -\\left\\langle\n\\frac{\\log_x y}{\\|\\log_x y \\|}, \\xi\n\\right\\rangle,\n\\] which completes the proof of the first variation formula. This classical result states that for a smooth variation of points \\(\\gamma(t)\\) and corresponding minimizing geodesics \\(c_t(s)\\) from \\(\\gamma(t)\\) to \\(y\\), we have: \\[\n\\frac{d}{dt}d(\\gamma(t),y)\\bigg|_{t=0} = - \\left\\langle \\frac{\\log_x y}{\\|\\log_x y\\|}, \\dot{\\gamma}(0)  \\right\\rangle.\n\\] Plugging this into the chain rule, we obtain \\[\n\\frac{d}{dt}d^2(\\gamma(t), y)\\bigg|_{t=0} = -2 \\langle \\log_x y, \\xi \\rangle.\n\\] By the definition of the Riemannian gradient, we have: \\[\nD f(x)[\\xi] = \\langle \\nabla_x f(x), \\xi \\rangle.\n\\] Since this identity must hold for every tangent vector \\(\\xi \\in T_x \\calM\\), it follows that \\[\n\\nabla_x f(x) = -2\\log_x y.\n\\]"

    "text": "Equivalence of Fisher-Rao Distance and Geodesic Distance of Square Root Densities\nWe are now ready to state the main result of this discussion. The Fisher-Rao distance between two distributions, \\(p_1(x) = p(x\\vert \\theta_1)\\) and \\(p_2(x) = p(x\\vert \\theta_2)\\), is twice the geodesic distance between their square-root transformed densities, \\(\\psi_1(x) = \\sqrt{p_1(x)}\\) and \\(\\psi_2(x) = \\sqrt{p_2(x)}\\), on \\(S^\\infty\\):\n\n\\[d_{FR}(p_1,p_2) = 2 \\textrm{arccos} \\left(\n\\int \\sqrt{p_1 (x) p_2(x)} dx\n\\right) \\tag{2}\\]\n\nTo verify Equation 2, consider an infinitesimal perturbation in \\(p(x)\\) by introducing a small variation: \\[\np(x) \\mapsto p(x) + \\epsilon h(x),\n\\tag{3}\\] where \\(h(x)\\) is an arbitrary function that integrates to 0 and \\(\\epsilon &gt; 0\\). This constraint ensures that \\(p(x) + \\epsilon h(x)\\) remains as a valid density. Our goal is to quantify how this small variation in \\(p(x)\\) induces a corresponding change in \\(\\psi(x)\\). In other words, we seek to measure the variation in the transformed function. Viewing the right-hand side of Equation 3 as a function of \\(\\epsilon\\), we apply a first-order Taylor expansion to the square-root transformation: \\[\n\\sqrt{p + \\epsilon h} \\approx \\sqrt{p} + \\frac{1}{2} \\frac{\\epsilon h}{\\sqrt{p}} + O(\\epsilon^2).\n\\] Thus, the infinitesimal perturbation in \\(\\psi(x)\\) is: \\[\n\\delta \\psi(x) = \\sqrt{p(x) + \\epsilon h(x)} - \\sqrt{p(x)}\n= \\frac{1}{2}\\frac{h(x)}{\\sqrt{p(x)}} \\epsilon + O(\\epsilon^2).\n\\tag{4}\\]\nFrom Equation 4, we observe that \\(\\delta \\psi(x)\\) is linear in \\(h(x)\\), demonstrating how small changes in \\(p(x)\\) translate to changes in \\(\\psi(x)\\)2. Recall that the Fisher-Rao metric corresponds to infinitesimal displacements in probability space. Given the embedding of densities via the square-root transformation, it is natural to measure perturbations by computing the squared norm: \\[\nds^2 = \\|\\delta \\psi \\|^2 = \\int \\left( \\frac{1}{2}\\frac{h(x)}{\\sqrt{p(x)}} \\right)^2 dx = \\frac{\\epsilon^2}{4} \\int \\frac{h(x)^2}{p(x)} dx.\n\\tag{5}\\]\nSince \\(h(x)\\) represents an infinitesimal change in \\(p(x)\\), we recognize that the integral in Equation 5 corresponds precisely to the Fisher information metric evaluated for an infinitesimal displacement. Consequently, we obtain \\[\nds^2 = \\frac{1}{4} \\int \\frac{h(x)^2}{p(x)} dx.\n\\] which reveals that the Fisher-Rao metric is \\(\\frac{1}{4}\\) times the standard metric on \\(S^\\infty\\) induced by the square-root transformation.\nBy combining these observations with the fact that geodesic distances scale inversely with the metric factor, we conclude that the geodesic distance computed in the Fisher-Rao metric is twice the standard geodesic distance on the unit sphere in \\(L^2\\). That is, for two densities \\(p_1\\) and \\(p_2\\) and their transformations \\(\\psi_1 = \\sqrt{p_1}\\) and \\(\\psi_2 = \\sqrt{p_2}\\) in \\(L_2\\), we have \\[\nd_{FR}(p_1, p_2) = 2 \\times d_{S^\\infty} (\\psi_1, \\psi_2) = 2 \\textrm{arccos} \\left( \\int\n\\sqrt{p_1 (x) p_2 (x)} dx\n\\right).\n\\]"

This formulation naturally extends to nonparametric probability densities, as the geodesic distance in \\(L^2\\) depends solely on the embedding.\nDespite the equivalence, some concerns remain regarding the computability of the Fisher-Rao distance. For instance, evaluating the integral can be challenging in many cases, particularly for high-dimensional distributions or arbitrary nonparametric densities, where numerical integration becomes intractable. Approximation via Monte Carlo methods, while useful, presents its own set of difficulties. Moreover, when densities are estimated, they may contain regions of extremely small values, leading to numerical precision issues.\nI would like to express my appreciation to Prof. Marco Radeschi for his kindness and patience in enduring my endless questions in his differential geometry course - many of which, in hindsight, seem absurd."

We also have that \\[\n\\begin{align*}\n\\frac{d^{n+1}}{dx^{n+1}} f_n(x) 2nx &=\n\\begin{pmatrix}\nn+1 \\\\ 0\n\\end{pmatrix}\nf_n^{(n+1)} (x) 2nx +\n\\begin{pmatrix}\nn+1 \\\\ 1\n\\end{pmatrix}\nf_n^{(n)} (x) 2n \\\\\n&= 2nx f_n^{(n+1)} (x) + 2n(n+1)f_n^{(n)}(x).\n\\end{align*}\n\\] Therefore, we have the following arrangement, \\[\n\\begin{equation*}\n    \\begin{gathered}\n    (x^2 - 1) f_n^{(n+2)} (x) + 2x(n+1)f_n^{(n+1)} (x) + n(n+1)f_n^{(n)} (x) =\n    2nx f_n^{(n+1)} (x) + 2n(n+1) f_n^{(n)} (x) \\\\\n    (x^2-1) f_n^{(n+2)} (x) + 2x f_n^{(n+1)}(x) - n(n+1)f_n^{(n)} (x) = 0 \\\\\n    (1- x^2) f_n^{(n+2)} (x) - 2x f_n^{(n+1)}(x) + n(n+1)f_n^{(n)} (x) = 0\n    \\end{gathered}\n\\end{equation*}\n\\] where the last line is in the form of Equation 1 so that we have \\(f_n^{(n)} (x)\\) as a solution.\n\n\nStep 2. Find a scaling factor.\nEven though \\(f_n^{(n)} (x)\\) as a solution, we have a requirement for the standard Legendre polynomial that \\(P_n (x)=1\\) for \\(x=1\\). Let us take a closer look at \\(f_n^{(n)}(x)\\) when evaluated at \\(x=1\\). \\[\n\\begin{align*}\nf_n^{(n)} (x) &= \\frac{d^n}{dx^n} (x^2-1)^n \\\\\n&= \\frac{d^n}{dx^n} (x+1)^n (x-1)^n \\\\\n&= \\sum_{k=0}^n \\begin{pmatrix}\nn \\\\ k\n\\end{pmatrix}\n\\left( (x+1)^n \\right)^{(k)} \\left( (x-1)^n \\right) ^{(n-k)} \\quad \\textrm{by the Leibniz's rule} \\\\\n&= \\sum_{k=0}^n \\begin{pmatrix}\nn \\\\ k\n\\end{pmatrix}\n\\frac{n!}{(n-k)!} (x+1)^{n-k} \\frac{n!}{k!} (x-1)^k \\qquad (*) \\\\\n&= n! \\sum_{k=0}^n \\begin{pmatrix}\nn \\\\ k\n\\end{pmatrix} \\frac{n!}{(n-k)! k!} (x+1)^{n-k} (x-1)^k \\\\\n&= n! \\sum_{k=0}^n \\begin{pmatrix}\nn \\\\ k\n\\end{pmatrix}^2 (x+1)^{n-k} (x-1)^k,\n\\end{align*}\n\\] Since we want to evaluate \\(f_n^{(n)} (x)\\) at \\(x=1\\), the last line of equations above tells us that all the terms but \\(k=0\\) become zero, \\[\n\\begin{equation*}\nf_n^{(n)} (x=1) = n! \\begin{pmatrix}\nn \\\\ 0\n\\end{pmatrix}^2 2^{n-0} = n! 2^n\n\\end{equation*}\n\\] which finally leads to define \\(P_n (x)\\) as \\[\nP_n (x) = \\frac{1}{n! 2^n}f_n^{(n)}(x)  = \\frac{1}{n! 2^n} \\frac{d^n}{dx^n} (x^2-1)^n\n\\] to fulfill the condition of \\(P_n (x) =1\\) for \\(x=1\\)."
