### Welcome!

I am a postdoctoral associate in the Department of Internal Medicine at Yale 
School of Medicine working with Prof. [Dennis Shung](https://medicine.yale.edu/profile/dennis_shung/). 
My research focuses on the use of mathematical tools from statistics, geometry, and topology in developing novel methods to answer abstruse scientific questions. The primary application domain is biomedical data analysis. I am also deeply interested in high-performance computing and statistical software development to democratize methodological innovations for practitioners.
