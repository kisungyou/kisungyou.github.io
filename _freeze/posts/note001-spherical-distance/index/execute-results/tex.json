Let $\\mathcal{P}(\\mathbb{S}^d)$ denote a space of probability densities on $\\mathbb{S}^d$. For two densities $f,g\\in\\mathcal{P}(\\mathbb{S}^d)$, it is frequently needed to measure dissimilarity between the two. Unfortunately, even for the most well-known distributions on the hypersphere, analytic formula for any discrepancy measure is rarely available, leading to require numerical schemes for approximation. Here we focus on $L_p$ distance between the two densities, \n\n$$\nL_p (f,g) = \\left( \\int_{\\mathbb{S}^d} |f(x) - g(x)|^p \\right)^{1/p}\n$$ {#eq-objective} \n\nand we show how to combine Monte Carlo way of integration by means of [importance sampling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Importance_sampling) to approximate @eq-objective.\n\n# Computation\n\nImportance sampling requires a proposal density. The easiest choice is to use uniform density $u(x)$ as an importance proposal since sampling from $u(x)$ is trivial. First, take a random sample from standard normal distribution $x \\sim \\mathcal{N}(0,I)$ in $\\mathbb{R}^{d+1}$. Then, the rest is to take $L_2$ normalization, i.e., $x \\leftarrow x / \\|x\\|_2$, which makes a sampled vector to have a unit norm. Given the sample generation process, we have the following \n\n$$\\begin{aligned}\nL_p (f,g)^p &= \\int_{\\mathbb{S}^d} |f(x)-g(x)|^p dx \\\\ \n&= \\int_{\\mathbb{S}^d} \\frac{|f(x)-g(x)|^p}{u(x)} u(x)  dx \\\\\n&= \\mathbb{E}_{u(x)} \\left\\lbrack \\frac{|f(x)-g(x)|^p}{u(x)} \\right\\rbrack\\\\\n&\\approx \\frac{1}{N} \\sum_{n=1}^N \\frac{|f(x)-g(x)|^p}{u(x)} \\,\\,\\textrm{for}\\,\\, x_n \\overset{iid}{\\sim} u(x),\n\\end{aligned}\n$$ where the last term gets better approximation as $N\\rightarrow \\infty$.\n\n\n# References {.unnumbered .unlisted}\n\n::: {#refs}\n:::\n\n::: {.content-visible unless-format=\"pdf\"}\n# Download the note {.unnumbered .unlisted}\n\nIf you would like to download the pdf version of this note, [click here](index.pdf).\n:::",
